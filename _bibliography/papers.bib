  abstract = {To provide early warning and support a rapid response to a novel virus through wastewater surveillance, it would be ideal to understand in advance which concentration and extraction methods are likely to be effective for dPCR-based methods, depending on virus characteristics. In this study, we spiked raw wastewater samples with eight human respiratory viruses and processed them with four methods that concentrate and/or extract nucleic acids from both liquid and solid fractions (Promega, Nanotrap, and InnovaPrep) or only the solid fraction of wastewater (Solids). Our findings provide encouraging evidence that all four methods combined with dPCR could detect an emerging virus in wastewater, although they differed in sensitivity. The pattern of recovery efficiency for adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza A viruses was consistent across methods, with Promega producing higher median recovery efficiencies, while distinct patterns were observed for coxsackieviruses. We also normalized the concentration data with two endogenous fecal indicators, PMMoV and Carjivirus (formerly crAssphage). We found that normalization could reduce method-associated differences if the indicator exhibited a recovery pattern similar to that of the target virus. These findings can guide the selection of concentration and extraction methods for wastewater monitoring based on the properties of target viruses, thus enhancing pandemic preparedness.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
