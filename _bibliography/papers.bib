  abstract = {To provide early warning and support a rapid response to a novel virus through wastewater surveillance, it would be ideal to understand in advance which concentration and extraction methods are likely to be effective for dPCR-based methods, depending on virus characteristics. In this study, we spiked raw wastewater samples with eight human respiratory viruses and processed them with four methods that concentrate and/or extract nucleic acids from both liquid and solid fractions (Promega, Nanotrap, and InnovaPrep) or only the solid fraction of wastewater (Solids). Our findings provide encouraging evidence that all four methods combined with dPCR could detect an emerging virus in wastewater, although they differed in sensitivity. The pattern of recovery efficiency for adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza A viruses was consistent across methods, with Promega producing higher median recovery efficiencies, while distinct patterns were observed for coxsackieviruses. We also normalized the concentration data with two endogenous fecal indicators, PMMoV and Carjivirus (formerly crAssphage). We found that normalization could reduce method-associated differences if the indicator exhibited a recovery pattern similar to that of the target virus. These findings can guide the selection of concentration and extraction methods for wastewater monitoring based on the properties of target viruses, thus enhancing pandemic preparedness.},
