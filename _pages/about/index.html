<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>My name is Allie Nguyen (a.k.a Minh-Anh Nguyen). I am a Ph.D. student in Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley under the mentorship of <a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/nelson" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Kara Nelson</a>. My current research project is on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). The project goal is to use WBE to generate a holistic picture of disease prevalence in not only areas with access to clinical testing but also geographically remote regions, thus improving pandemic preparedness in a broad-scale application. Specifically, I’m researching the different forms of 8 types of viruses and their persistence in raw wastewater. I’m also very interested in environmental public health and how to utilize engineering as a tool to elevate the safety and well-being of the population.</p> <p>I was born and raised in Hanoi, Vietnam. There is no doubt about the severe impacts of climate change and global warming on Vietnam, a tropical developing country, especially with its significantly increasing manufacturing rate and the negligence of local industries about their environmental consequences. I have witnessed by myself for years how Vietnamese citizens, including my family members, have to endure those impacts on a daily basis. Besides, despite the authorities’ efforts to spread awareness about these issues, people either lack understanding, don’t care, or know but cannot do anything to improve their lives. This motivated me to move to the US to pursue an undergraduate degree at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I completed a Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Engineering and participated in research projects regarding resource recovery from solid waste (with <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cege/faculty/sebastian-behrens" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Sebastian Behrens</a>) and municipal wastewater treatment using biochar (with <a href="https://bbe.umn.edu/people/ulrike-tschirner" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Ulrike Tschirner</a>).</p> <p>In my free time, I like going on photo walks (check out my photos <a href="https://alliengma.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>), cooking, and baking. I’ve recently taken up crocheting as a new hobby as well.</p> </body></html>
