I am a Ph.D. student in Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. My research topic is wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). My other research interests include environmental public health and sustainable urbanization. 

I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering. Throughout my undergraduate education, I have participated in environmental engineering research projects in resource recovery from solid waste and municipal wastewater treatment using biochar. I also held leadership positions in student organizations, specifically the College of Engineering International Ambassadors (President) and the American Society of Civil Engineers (Historian).

In my free time, I like going on photo walks (check out my photos [here](https://alliengma.wordpress.com/)), cooking, and baking. I've recently taken up crocheting as a new hobby as well.
