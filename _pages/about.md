<h2>About me</h2>
Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley under the mentorship of [Professor Kara Nelson](https://nelsongroup.berkeley.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of environmental water microbiology and public health. 

I am currently involved in multiple projects. One project focuses on wastewater-based epidemiology, specifically investigating the persistence of viral nucleic acid signals in wastewater and how surfactants may affect their stability. Another project explores how sub-sewershed-level sampling can enhance efforts to improve health equity in wastewater-based surveillance. In an upcoming project, I will study the impact of blending purified direct potable reuse water with conventional drinking water directly within distribution systems, with a focus on implications for drinking water quality and safety.

In my free time, I enjoy photography (check out my photos [here](https://alliemnguyen.wordpress.com/)), dancing, and listening to music. I'm also constantly trying out new hobbies, such as crocheting, sewing, cooking, and baking :)
