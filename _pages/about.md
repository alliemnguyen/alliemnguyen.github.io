<h2>About me</h2>
My name is Allie Nguyen (a.k.a Minh-Anh Nguyen). I am a Ph.D. student in Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley under the mentorship of [Professor Kara Nelson](https://nelsongroup.berkeley.edu/). My current research project is on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). The project goal is to use WBE to generate a holistic picture of disease prevalence in not only areas with access to clinical testing but also geographically remote regions, thus improving pandemic preparedness in a broad-scale application. Specifically, I'm researching the different forms of 8 types of viruses and their persistence in raw wastewater. I'm also very interested in environmental public health and how to utilize engineering to elevate the population's safety and well-being.

<h2>Education</h2>

**Ph.D.** in Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley (anticipated 2027)<br>
**M.S** in Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley (2023)<br>
**Bachelor** of Environmental Engineering, University of Minnesota (2022)<br>

<h2>More about me</h2>

I was born and raised in Hanoi, Vietnam. A tropical developing country, Vietnam suffers from severe impacts of climate change and global warming, especially with its significantly increasing manufacturing rate and the negligence of local industries about their environmental consequences. I have witnessed for years how Vietnamese citizens, including my family members, have to endure those impacts daily. Besides, despite the authorities’ efforts to spread awareness about these issues, people either lack understanding, don’t care, or know but cannot do anything to improve their lives. This motivated me to move to the US to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. During my time in Minnesota, I participated in research projects regarding resource recovery from solid waste (with [Professor Sebastian Behrens](https://cse.umn.edu/cege/behrens-sebastian)) and municipal wastewater treatment using biochar (with [Professor Ulrike Tschirner](https://bbe.umn.edu/people/ulrike-tschirner)).

In my free time, I like going on photo walks (check out my photos [here](https://alliemnguyen.wordpress.com/)), crocheting, cooking, and baking.
